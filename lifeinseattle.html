            <p>Seattle is a huge place, so here are ways you can get around the city to explore new places. Note that you may want to have an ORCA card with you when using public transport.</p>
            
            <p>King Country Metro:</p>
            <p>The main bus company for Shoreline CC students. The company offers four main bus lines which all stop at campus:</p>

            <p> - 5</p>
            <p> - 330</p>
            <p> - 345</p>
            <p>Feel free to use this bus to explore the city, as there are many more that bring people around, and not just the campus.</p>
            <p>Use Google Maps for a more accurate list of bus times.</p>
            <p>1 Line:</p>
            <p>The 1-Line is Seattle’s main train system. It begins at Northgate, south of campus, and can bring you all the way to the Seattle-Tacoma Airport at a very cheap price.</p>
